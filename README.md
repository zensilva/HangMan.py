## Introduction

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. It is a fun and challenging way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your name and choose the difficulty level (1-10) to determine the number of lives.
3. The game will start, and you need to guess the letters to complete the word.
4. Enter a letter to guess.
5. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
6. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a life.
7. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of lives.

## Design and Functionality

The game is implemented in Python and utilizes random word selection from a predefined word list. It provides a user-friendly interface to input guesses and provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

The game tracks the number of remaining lives and updates the word display as the player makes guesses. It also prevents duplicate guesses and provides relevant messages for game outcomes (win or loss).

## End of Game

- If you complete the word before running out of lives, you win the game.
- If you run out of lives before completing the word, you lose the game.

## Objective Oriented Programming

The Hangman Game employs principles of object-oriented programming to organize the code into classes and functions, enhancing code modularity and reusability. It also incorporates error handling and input validation to ensure a smooth user experience and prevent unexpected errors.

The game code is well-structured and documented, making it easy to understand and extend for future enhancements or modifications.
